Blackjack is a casino game where players take cards trying to add up their total value to 21, without going over. A player starts with 2 cards, as does the dealer. The player then decides if they want to take another card to attempt to bring their total closer to 21. If they go over, the 'bust' and lose. All cards are worth their value. Face cards are worth 10. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 by your choosing. If a player's first two cards are a card of 10 value and an ace, the have a total of 21. This is called 'blackjack' and they automatically win. Bets are placed before the cards are dealt. If a play wins, they get their bet back and the house matches their bet. If they lose, the house takes their bet.
